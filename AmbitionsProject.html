<p class="p1">&lt;h1&gt;Educational Background&lt;/h1&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">As a psychology major at a technical school, I have found myself at an interesting</p>
<p class="p1">intersection of fields of thought. Not only have I learned to work with peers</p>
<p class="p1">of diverse backgrounds like engineering and design, but I've also learned the importance</p>
<p class="p1">of studying technology from the perspective of a social scientist.</p>
<p class="p1">I've taken many courses throughout my time at IIT which have fostered this unexpected</p>
<p class="p1">fascination.</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">I've taken a wide array of courses that touched upon fascinating topics like</p>
<p class="p1">artificial intelligence, human-computer interaction, cognition, digital design, and</p>
<p class="p1">science and technology studies. These topics were not found in just one department like</p>
<p class="p1">communication, for example. Rather, I studied these topics in departments like philosophy,</p>
<p class="p1">business, humanities, and psychology. These courses have led me to become interested</p>
<p class="p1">in user experience design and user research as a career.</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;h1&gt;Professional Ambitions&lt;/h1&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">I hope to become an influential social scientist within the field of technology. I</p>
<p class="p1">feel as though my understanding of how people interact with machines and how machines</p>
<p class="p1">have the ability to influence people will give me an 'edge' in the UX field. I think</p>
<p class="p1">it would be really cool to design things that function well and that people enjoy</p>
<p class="p1">using. Especially because technology is becoming one of the main drivers of our</p>
<p class="p1">society today and there’s a constant push towards technical training, I think the</p>
<p class="p1">need to keep technology human-focused will be increasingly relevant.</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">I hope to learn as much as I can on the development side of things.</p>
<p class="p1">I feel as though in order to enter a field like UX, it is imperative to understand</p>
<p class="p1">all sides of the design process, including the technical aspect. I also would like</p>
<p class="p1">to reflect, perhaps on my own, why a 'web development' titled class could be taught in</p>
<p class="p1">the communications department rather than computer science. Because of all these</p>
<p class="p1">curiosities, I'm looking forward to learning a lot in this course.</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/body&gt;</p>
