# My Background and Ambitions Project

## Educational Background

* As a psychology major at a technical school, I have found myself at an interesting
intersection of fields of thought. Not only have I learned to work with peers
of diverse backgrounds like engineering and design, but I've also learned the importance
of studying technology from the perspective of a social scientist.
I've taken many courses throughout my time at IIT which have fostered this unexpected
fascination.
* I've taken a wide array of courses that touched upon fascinating topics like
artificial intelligence, human-computer interaction, cognition, digital design, and
science and technology studies. These topics were not found in just one department like
communication, for example. Rather, I studied these topics in departments like philosophy,
business, humanities, and psychology. These courses have led me to become interested
in user experience design and user research as a career.


## Professional Ambitions

*  I hope to become an influential social scientist within the field of technology. I
feel as though my understanding of how people interact with machines and how machines
have the ability to influence people will give me an 'edge' in the UX field. I think
it would be really cool to design things that function well and that people enjoy
using. Especially because technology is becoming one of the main drivers of our
society today and our policy makers keep pushing for technical generations, I think the
need to keep technology human-focused will be increasingly relevant.

* I hope to learn as much as I can on the technical development side of things.
I feel as though in order to enter a field like UX, it is imperative to understand
all sides of the design process, including the programming aspect. I also would like
to further investigate why a 'web development' titled class could fall under
the communications department rather than computer science. Because of all these
curiosities, I'm looking forward to learning a lot in this course.
